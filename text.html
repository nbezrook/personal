<p class="b">By analyzing the material conditions and economic motivations of both Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is clear whatever Azerbaijan and Armenia as governments stand to win in this conflict must be weighed against what the ordinary people of Azerbaijan and Armenia stand to lose. More importantly, the ordinary people of Armenia and Azerbaijan must understand these material conditions— without overcoming the false consciousness I’ve spoken of here, every conflict becomes ideological and the basis of it becomes mysterious. Through ideology, conflicts are not understood to be rooted in economic or political matters but rather irrational, unchangeable impulses. Through ideology, Armenians and Azeris do not understand their conflict as that of conflicting global economic interests but a racialized fight to the death between two inherent enemies.

<p class="b">Or… maybe she was mistaken and she was only the physical embodiment of a movement set into place long before she was even needed, the rehearsals of which could be seen in the months-long aftermath of your average celebrity-murder tragedy. You could call it paranoia, but it wasn’t the paranoia of your conspiracy-creep who refuses to accept the grim proposition that maybe no-one was in control and we’re all just unwilling participants in a cosmically-rigged dice game that’s just as likely to leave you with snake eyes as it is to leave you with boxcars… no, it was the paranoia of a she-creep who knows that everyone including herself are simply manifestations of currents, historical/cultural/physical like a fish caught in a amniotic drift amongst fellow pisces… the paranoia of a she-creep who knows that no one person is in control but rather that what she feels & does was only the ultimate output of a system in which she is only a single biological entity in a huge pool of other biological entities… and ultimately you can’t escape that system more than you could escape gravity or a bullet traveling way quicker than you ever could.

<p class="b">This must be the beach – two lovers embrace as the sun passes through the thin grating of fine mesh. I stumble away from the shore, and there are drunken men stumbling into the street with sand on their lips, brushing the sweat from their brow as flies gather on decaying marine wildlife, their nostrils sipping on brine, and I can feel the broken seashells jab into the skin of my toes, covering my eyes with my hands to watch a seagull fly over me as a breeze hits my ears, perching onto the stairs, opening its beak to emit a loud bang followed by the clattering of glass. I smell it; the air fills with fine mercury dust, glittering like dew as streaks of light cover my vision, coating the lifeless mannequins with pearly snow.

<p class="b">That is the paradox of monoculture. Everything becomes the same, but its currency is attention. What provokes attention eventually becomes absorbed, and survives in an undead state if it can be exploited for value. Ideologies distinguish themselves by their performance, hiding their bland sameness beneath. The Democrats signal their virtue and commitment to environmental causes, then lobby for the industries that pollute. Donald Trump garners his support not because of his record as a public servant, but as an icon of America who sends a message. The Chinese Communist Party reaffirms its commitment to socialism, then pushes for market liberalization. Islamic extremists demand a return to the ancient ways of living, but make videogame-inspired music videos out of their massacres. Boring debates won’t solve anything anymore — if you want to defeat Islam, replace it with something more glamorous.

<p class="b">This is why I must use the term surfaces when speaking of cultural artifacts or art works, to acknowledge and assert that indeed a massive change in our engagement with cultural artifacts has occurred. Owning surfaces is an inherently an absurd concept, for they are endlessly replicable without loss to whatever arbitrary data is deemed its original. This was the great innovation of Sturtevant’s work, prefiguring the postmodern artist as a curator of surfaces she gathers from other sources. Deleting a surface cannot mean physical death, for nothing physically changes except the organization of a few electrons. Even then it may still reside in memory, in the file system, or across a global network of servers and clients. The paranoia I speak of only increases on social media, where everything is between an uncertain flux of existing and non-existing — context, meaning, joy; something has to be missing from this image, but I wouldn’t even know how to recover it. We don’t know what it is we’re mourning, nevertheless we are mourning it.

</a><br>
<p class="b">A critique of ontology which introduces seepage, the process of properties revealing themselves from the matrix forms of an object. What follows is the observation that these properties have their own system of relations, placed in the context of a culture of objects which engages a revealing process. An argument is presented for considering organization as the principle which allows for seepage, understood as an inherently informative and intuitive process where the organization of objects reveals some property and consequently makes us less uncertain about the object. Objects are deposited to be a continual process where the properties represented by the organization of its constituent parts change as they seep beyond its matrix. An object cannot inform us of all of its properties immediately, rather we acquaint ourselves with them as they are brought forth and become enframed as part of how we understand said object.
